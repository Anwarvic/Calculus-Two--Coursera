# Calculus Two (Coursera)

This repo contains my solution to the Coursera course "[Calculus Two: Sequences and Series](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-calculus)" created by Prof. Jim  Fowler from The Ohio State University.  You can find the solution as txt files. 



## Note

This course consists of 7 weeks, I have solved them all except the 6th and 7th week because I'm too busy :).
